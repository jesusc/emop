Examples
========

* Compute all subclasses
* Link models and meta-models
* Intercept validation

* Prototype modelling

* Implement the type-object pattern => Implicit promotions

Package MOP operations as libraries
	=> Annotations + an interpreter to instantiate the MOP

* A subset of our MOP is already covered by ENotification framework, but
  - Not all (e.g., onInstantiate -> different from ADD)
  - Other facilities: validation, code-gen
  - We consider also manipulation (e.g., ATL, Epsilon, Xtext)
  - It provides an homogenous protocolo for interacting with the meta-modelling framework
  
For generated meta-models we either to 
	a) to extends JET templates
	b) generate an aspect for each class


Our implementation using aspects also show that could be
possible to modularly define the MOP...
