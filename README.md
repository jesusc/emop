# EMOP : A meta-object protocol for EMF

EMOP is a prototype implementation of a meta-object protocol for EMF.
It uses AspectJ to inject additional behaviour to EMF.
To properly execute EMOP you need to set up some parameters to 
enable Aspect/J on Eclipse. See [this link](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/incubator/aspects/equinox-aspects-quick-start.php) for a complete reference.
